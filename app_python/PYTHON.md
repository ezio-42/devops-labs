# Python application best practices

* Use version control system (git)
* Add license information
* Use dependency management tool (poetry)
* Follow style guidelines (PEP8)
* Use libraries from PyPI
* Follow the Zen of Python
* Use virtual environment (via poetry)
* Use data classes
* Use appropriate .gitignore file
* Use type checker (mypy)
* Use pre-commit
  * black  - auto code formatter and linter
  * flake8 - linter and error checker
  * isort  - sort imports
  * mypy   - type checker
* Use production ready libraries
  * Aiohttp - is asynchronous library which provides web-server and web-client functionality.
    Used by large companies ([link](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/powered_by.html)).
    * Pros:
      * This is one of most permonant Python web frameworks for IO bound tasks
        (if you are looking for CPU-bound tasks, why you are using Python?),
        because uses fastest event-loop written in plain C.
      * Contains small set of required functionality which can be extended by plugins,
        so modularity principles applied and your app can use only necessary dependencies.
      * No dictating "right way" for developers, your application can be designed
        as you want, not as "framework wants".
    * Cons
      * Because library in lower level comparing to others,
        requires more experience from developer.
